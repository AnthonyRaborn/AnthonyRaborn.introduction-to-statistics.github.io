This data will represent a sample of 100 college-aged (18 yrs old – 22 yrs old) males, with data collected on their height (in inches) and weight (in pounds).\nThe R code for generating this data can be seen here.\nNext is a scatterplot of the resulting data. What can we tell about the association between height and weight from this plot alone?\n(positive correlation; positive/linear association/relationship; as height increases weight increases)\nLet’s consider how we can draw a line that tells us the most likely weight for someone represented by our sample, given their height.\n\n\n\nheight_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(\n    mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight)\n    ) +\n    geom_point() +\n    xlab('Height (inches)') +\n    ylab('Weight (pounds)') +\n    theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nBasic scatterplot\n\n\n\nMale College Students Height (in inches; x-axis) and Weight (in pounds; y-axis)\n\n\nIn regression, the line of best fit is estimated with a process known as “least squares estimation”. We take it as true, for now, that this is the best way to create a prediction line of best fit for a linear association between two variables.\nThis process finds an intercept and slope that minimizes squared distance between line and observations (this distance is also known as error) for ALL observations simultaneously. Our predictions based on this line are as mathematically close as possible to all the observations in our data. In a moment, we will look at an example to help us understand why SQUARED error is used over OBSERVED error.\n\n\n\n\nLine of Best Fit\nLeast Squares Estimator:\n\nMinimizes squared distance between line and observations (error) for ALL observations\n\n\\[\\text{L}_{min} = \\text{argmin}(\\Sigma_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2)\\]\n\nThe equation here defines the problem mathematically. The important part to understand is that we are taking the difference between the observed values, \\(y_i\\), and the values predicted by the regression line, \\(\\hat{y_i}\\), as our error. We then square the error and add the sums. We are looking for a line that produces the values \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) that results in the smallest possible sum of squared errors in our sample.\n\n\n\n\nBad fit:\n\nheight_data &lt;-\n  height_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # bad_prediction = 30 + 2*height \n    bad_prediction = -.9276 + 2.471429*height\n    , bad_error = weight - bad_prediction\n    , prediction = lm(weight ~ height) |&gt; predict()\n    , error = weight - prediction\n    , sum_error_bad = sum(bad_error)\n    , sum_error_best = sum(error)\n    , SSE_bad = sum(bad_error^2)\n    , SSE_best = sum(error^2)\n    )\n\nheight_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = height, y = weight)\n  ) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = -.9276, slope = 2.471429, color = 'red') +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymax = weight, ymin = bad_prediction)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  ylab(\"Weight (pounds)\") +\n  xlab(\"Height (inches)\") +\n  xlim(60, 80) + ylim(150, 200)\n\n\n\n\nWith a poorly-fitting line\n\n\n\nMale College Students Height (x) and Weight (y)\n\n\nThis next graph shows what I am calling a “line of bad fit”. The red line looks like it provides reasonable estimates of weight for height values near the center of the distribution, but for both shorter and taller individuals it produces estimates that are noticeably further way from the prediction line. The black lines between the points and the red line are the errors.

The errors should be noticeably smaller at the upper and lower values of height. Again, the black lines between the points and the blue line are the errors.

These lines are the same as in the previous graphs. We also see four values imposed on the graph: S(e), the sum of errors (notice that these are regular, NOT squared, errors) for both lines, and SS(e), the sum of squared errors for both lines.\nNotice that the sum of unsquared errors is zero for both lines, but the sum of squared errors is lower for the blue least squares estimate line. Does everyone see why SS(e) is better than S(e) for regression lines?\n(unsquared errors allows positive and negative errors to cancel; multiple possible solutions with unsquared errors)\nIs there another method of minimizing errors that you think could also work?\n(e.g., absolute errors)"

Now, our observed x values are used to estimate \\(\\hat{y}\\) values with our estimated regression parameters, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) .\nWith a bit of algebra, we can redefine the Least Squares Estimator L as a function of the estimated regression line and the observed y values.\nAny questions so far?\nFrom here, we will see some of the derivation. If you are unfamiliar or out of practice with calculus, don’t worry; we will only consider the final equations moving forward.

It is interpreted as the expected or mean value of the outcome variable y when the predictor variable x equals zero.\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the regression coefficient or regression slope.

Note that “results from” doesn’t mean “caused by” as we are not making causal relationships right now!\nAn interesting mathematical fact: the regression coefficient in a simple linear regression is a units-adjust transformation of the Pearson correlation; that is, for a given data set, \\(\\beta_1\\) and the correlation are directly related!\n\n\n\nRelationship between \\(\\beta_1\\) and Correlation\n\nheight_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(\n    mapping = aes(x = height, y = weight)\n    ) +\n    geom_point() +\n    xlab('Height (inches)') +\n    ylab('Weight (pounds)') +\n    theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nBasic scatterplot\n\n\n\nMale College Students Height (in inches; x-axis) and Weight (in pounds; y-axis)\n\n\nLet’s briefly show how these are related.\nFirst, take a look at the data we originally created. How would you characterize the correlation between height and weight? If you had to estimate the correlation coefficient, what value would you use?\n(characterized: strong, positive; estimate: anything greater than .7 but not 1.0, definitely not negative)\n\n\nPearson Correlation: \\[r_{(x,y)} = \\frac{\\Sigma^n_{i=1}(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(x,y)}{\\text{sd}(x)\\text{sd}(y)}\\]\nRegression slope: \\[\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}=\\frac{\\text{cov}(x,y)}{\\text{var}(x)}\\]\n\nLet’s revisit the equation for the Pearson correlation. Remember that correlation is unitless and can range from negative 1 to positive 1 but cannot go beyond this range.\nLet’s compare that equation to the algebraic equation for beta_1. It should be evident that beta_1 is in units of y. Why?\n(when x increased by 1 unit, y increases by beta_1 units, so beta_1 is in y units over x units. Mathematically, cov(x,y) is in x*y unites, and var(x) is in x^2 units, so we get y/x units. However, we generally interpret beta_1 in one-x-unit changes so the x units in the denominator are not important for interpretation)\nSince both values use the covariance between x and y in the numerator, and the difference between the denominators is the variance of x and sd of both variables; some algebra makes them equivalent (but we’ll skip over the specifics).\n\n\n\nRelating the two:\\(r = \\hat{\\beta_1}*\\frac{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}}\\)\n\nCode\npearson_correlation &lt;-\n  cor(height_data$height, height_data$weight) |&gt;\n  round(3)\n\nregression_slope &lt;-\n  lm(weight ~ height, data = height_data)$coefficients[2] |&gt;\n  round(3)\n\nnumerator &lt;-\n  (height_data$height - mean(height_data$height))^2 |&gt;\n  sum() |&gt; sqrt() \ndenominator &lt;-\n  (height_data$weight - mean(height_data$weight))^2 |&gt;\n  sum() |&gt; sqrt()\nunits_adjustment &lt;-\n  (numerator/denominator) |&gt; round(3)\n\n\npaste0(\n  \"r = \", pearson_correlation, \n  \"\\nbeta_1 = \", regression_slope, \n  \"\\nunits-adjustment = \", units_adjustment,\n  \"\\nr = beta_1 * units-adjustment?: \", \n  (regression_slope*units_adjustment) |&gt; \n    round(3)\n  ) |&gt;\n  cat()\n\nr = 0.909\nbeta_1 = 1.749\nunits-adjustment = 0.52\nr = beta_1 * units-adjustment?: 0.909\n\n\n\n\nOn the left, we see the results from the algebraic manipulation I alluded to. By multiplying \\(\\beta_1\\) by the units-adjustment value, sqrt(SS(x)) / sqrt(SS(y)), the two values should be the same.\nOn the right is some R code that performs these calculations automatically. The cor function should look familiar. I took a shortcut and used the lm function instead of calculating \\(\\beta_1\\) myself, but we will see on the next slide that this result is functionally equivalent to the algebraic calculations on the same data. And, after calculating the units-adjustment value for the data and multiplying it with \\(\\beta_1\\), we see that in fact the correlation and regression slope are related."

By fitting the model, saving it to the lm_height_weight object, then using the summary() function on this object, we get a printout of the regression model, including a multitude of statistics. We will look further into these statistics in another lecture, so for now look for the Coefficients and their respective Estimate values. These values are basically equivalent to the values we found algebraically and to the values we used to simulate the data."
